[Stormpath-Express](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-express) is an extension for Express.js that makes it incredibly simple to add users and user data to your application. It aims to completely abstract away all user registration, login, authentication, and authorization problems, and make building secure websites painless. And the best part? 

[Stormpath](http://stormpath.com/) is a User Management API that reduces development time with scalable user infrastructure.
